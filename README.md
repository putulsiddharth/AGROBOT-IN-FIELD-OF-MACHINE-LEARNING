# Agrobot-in-field-of-Machine-Learning

            Objective of the project

To use technologies like Machine Learning and Web  Development to create a system to aid farmers in crop selection, crop recommendation, agricultural blogs and more.

To create a interactive UI to allow more people to use this system.

            Technical Specification
            
Flask framework : Website Backend Development
Random Forest model : Crop Prediction  System
K Nearest Neighbor model :Crop Recommendation System
Sqlalchemy package : Create connection between phpmyadmin database and flask program
HTML, CSS and Bootstrap : Website Frontend Development

        CONSTRAINTS, ALTERNATIVES & TRADE OFFS
        
Data collection is the biggest constraint in a ML model, once the data is collected and validated for the real time use with proper amount of testing and training data, it then becomes ready to use for the algorithms.

Another constraint faced was to keep the user interface easy as it is to be used by farmers.

Since the website is hosted on a local system, scaling will be an issue as the website won’t be able to handle the load if number of visits increase.

An alternative to using Flask for backend development would be using node.js or spring boot for backend development.

              COST ANALYSIS

Software used for the project prototype are open source so there is no cost associated with it.
A dedicated plan on a database management service can cost up to Rs. 4000 per month with 
10GB to 4TB of storage
2GB to 768GB RAM
Elastic scalability and auto-scaling.

For deployment of website will cost around Rs. 400 per month with
Website security (secure sockets layer)
Custom domain connection﻿
24/7 support﻿
Guidance and analytics﻿
3 Social media platforms﻿
500 Email marketing sends per month﻿


NOTE : Use python3.6 or create virtual environment for python3.6
